## code -in-place

A free, human-centric, intro-to-coding course in the time of COVID-19 Is this the course with the most teachers ever? 
In 2020, at the start of the pandemic, as an act of community service over 900 teachers from around the world came together to offer a first-of-its-kind volunteer-led course called Code in Place, hosted by Stanford University. 
Code in Place was a great, uplifting, learning experience and over 10,000 students learned how to code in python. It was such a good time we are going to do it again in April 2021. 
The courses are finished, but we might have future offerings.

## The Idea
Code in Place was first offered right when the COVID-19 global lock down started. While we were about to teach Stanford's introduction to Computer Science course we had a thought along the lines of "this time is hard for lots of folks, what can we do to be helpful?" As an act of community service, a group of computer science instructors came together to offer a high quality learning experience free of charge for people who want to learn introductory coding, subject to availability.
## Who: Learners, with no programming experience, and time to dedicate to learning.
## Where: Anywhere with internet.
## When: Offered twice. Once in 2020. Once a year later in 2021.
What made Code in Place special? We recruited and trained one volunteer teacher for every 10 students in order to create a vibrant community of teaching and learning. We believe that the magnitude of people who want to teach computer science is large and may be roughly proportional to the magnitude of people who want to learn. Why? Teaching is joyful and teaching is the best way to learn both content and team leading skills. We do hope that this course inspires new ways to provide human-centered learning for all.

It was perhaps the single course with the largest number of teachers ever. Across two offerings we had over:

2,000 section leaders teach 20,000 students 1:10 student to section leader ratio 1/2 of Stanford's CS106A Students and section leaders came from around the world, and represented a broad distribution of backgrounds. Everyone is welcome is one of our mottos (but for legal reasons participants needed to be over 18)
